Overview
Build a command line tool that provides information about the top posts from the
Reddit API. Feel free to be creative.

On each run of your program, it should print out:
1. New posts from the last program execution,
2. Posts that are no longer within the top 75 posts.
3. Posts that had a vote count change and by how much.
